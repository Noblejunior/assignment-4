    <p>
        As an IT student you may think coding may be my main hobby ,which isn't 100% true .<br>
        I love to code and teach people how to code.<br>
        The feeling of being situated behind my laptop trying to code,makes me feel happy.<br>
        Being able to write some lines of codes which are able to compile makes be feel like very happy.<br>
        My laptop is always helpful during coding. I feel happy when coding<br>
        I can code in JAVA,CSS,HTML,C++ and a little bit of PYTHON.<br>
        ON the other hand if im not coding then im either watiching a movie or playing a video game.<br>
        Some type of movies i like are science fiction (SCI FI) movies, action movies and adventurous movies.<br>
        The reason why i like "SCI FI" movies is that i learn some termnologies from the movie.<br>
        I also play video games to free my mind and i also learn from the game bacause i want to create my own game.<br>
