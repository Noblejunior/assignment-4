        <p>
        My name is <mark>Nkum Gyang Julius</mark>.I am 20 years of age.I live in Accra. I am a Ghanaian. I am the first born of my parent.
        We are four in number and I have always felt responsible for my family.
         I love my parents and siblings dearly and the feeling is mutual.
        My father works at Food and Drugs Authority and my mother works at Ghana education service.  
        I am in the university at University of Ghana and currently in level 200, offering <i>Information Technology.</i> 
        I love to listen to music, and play games at my leisure. This is how I often clear my head or distress myself. <br>
        I am an outgoing person with a good sense of humor and I make friends easily. 
        My friends say that I am funny and fun to be with. I sometimes go out of my way to be nice to people and help them out. 
        I guess this is rooted in my sense of responsibility which was honed into me by my parents considering that 
        I am the first born of my family.  
        I’m always looking for ways to develop my skills and learn new things not just in school but outside the school environment. 
        I share ideas with my friends, we learn interesting things about one another, and most of the people I associate with I met with while on the lookout for ways to advance my skills.
        I have every intention to make the world a better place. 
        I know I’m no superman and I have no concrete plans right now, but I am on a road to discovery. 
        I know I’m on the right track and soon enough I’ll be close to where I want to be.
